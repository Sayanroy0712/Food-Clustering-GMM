# GAUSSIAN MIXTURE MODELS

A Gaussian mixture model is a soft clustering technique used in unsupervised learning to determine the probability that a given data point belongs to a cluster. It's composed of several Gaussians, each identified by k ∈ {1,…, K}, where K is the number of clusters in a data set.

In a Gaussian Mixture Model:

Components: There are K Gaussian components, each characterized by its own mean vector and covariance matrix. These components represent the underlying clusters in the data.

Probability Density Function (PDF): The probability density function of a GMM is a weighted sum of the PDFs of individual Gaussian distributions.

Parameters: The parameters of a GMM include:

Means : Represent the centers of the Gaussian components.
Covariance matrices : Describe the shape and orientation of the clusters.
Mixing coefficients : Determine the relative weights of the Gaussian components in the mixture.
Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm: GMMs are typically estimated using the EM algorithm, which iteratively refines the parameter estimates based on the observed data. The EM algorithm involves two main steps:

Expectation (E-step): Compute the posterior probabilities (responsibilities) of each data point belonging to each Gaussian component.
Maximization (M-step): Update the parameters (means, covariances, and mixing coefficients) based on the current posterior probabilities.
Convergence: Repeating E-step and M-step until convergance is achieved.
Clustering: Once the GMM parameters are estimated, each data point is assigned to the Gaussian component with the highest posterior probability. This assignment determines the clusters in the data.

Gaussian Mixture Models are widely used in various applications, including clustering, density estimation, and generative modeling of data. They are particularly useful when the underlying data distribution is complex and cannot be effectively modeled by a single Gaussian distribution.
